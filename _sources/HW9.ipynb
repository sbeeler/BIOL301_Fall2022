That is, if we are comparing two sequences of different lengths, we will consider the excess basepairs of the longer sequence to all be differences. Concretely, that means a function call like `differences(\"AATT\",\"ATTTCCGG\")` should return `5` since the sequences have 1 difference in addition to the second sequences being 4 basepairs longer.
