For looking up symbols you may need, you can use any of the many [cheat sheets](http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf) you can find by asking Google.  I have provided a few that I think will come up the most often at the end of this tutorial.\n",

In general, a backward slash precedes special symbols or commands in LaTeX.  If we want another Greek letter, like $\\theta$, we use `\\theta`.  Now, also note that I used \"`\\mathrm{e}`\" for the base of the natural logarithm.  I was signaling to LaTeX that I wanted the character written in Roman font, and not italics, so I used `\\mathrm`.  Anything in the braces following the function `\\mathrm` is rendered in Roman font.  Note the difference.\n",
