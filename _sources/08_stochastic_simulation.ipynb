    "The basic idea is that events (such as those outlined above) are rare, discrete, separate events.  I.e., each event is an arrival of a Poisson process.  The Gillespie algorithm starts with some state, $(m_0,p_0)$.  Then a state change, *any* state change, will happen in some time $\\Delta t$ that has a certain probability distribution (which we will show is Exponential momentarily).  The probability that the state change that happens is reaction $j$ is proportional to $a_j$.  That is to say, state changes with high propensities are more likely to occur.  Thus, choosing which of the $n$ state changes happens in $\\Delta t$ is a matter of drawing an integer $j$ in $[1,n]$ where the probability of drawing $j$ is\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{a_j}{\\sum_i a_i}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we determine how long the state change took? We can consider each possible stage change as a Poisson process that occurs with rate $a_i$. And as we saw last semester, the time it takes for arrival of a [Poisson process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process) is [Exponentially distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution). So the wait time for each given event will be exponentially distributed with mean wait time of $1/a_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we are interested in the chance of **any** of our state changes occurring. Since we consider each of the possible events as being independent from each other, the rate at with **any** event occurs will be the sum of all $a_i$, and accordingly the wait time for *something* to occur will be exponentially distributed with mean $1/\\sum a_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these consideration in place, the Gillespie algorithm then proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Choose an initial condition, e.g., $m = p = 0$.\n",
    "2. Calculate the propensity for each of the enumerated state changes.  The propensities may be functions of $m$ and $p$, so they need to be recalculated for every $m$ and $p$ we encounter.\n",
    "3. Choose how much time the reaction will take by drawing out of an exponential distribution with a mean equal to $\\left(\\sum_i a_i\\right.)^{-1}$.  This means that a change arises from a Poisson process.\n",
    "4. Choose what state change will happen by drawing a sample out of the discrete distribution where $P_i = \\left.a_i\\middle/\\left(\\sum_i a_i\\right)\\right.$.  In other words, the probability that a state change will be chosen is proportional to its propensity.\n",
    "5. Increment time by the time step you chose in step 3.\n",
    "6. Update the states according to the state change you choose in step 4.\n",
